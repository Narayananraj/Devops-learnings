# 📖 Docker Basic Concepts

This section covers the fundamental concepts of **Docker**, its components, and its architecture — essential for understanding how containerization works.

---

## 📌 What is Docker?

**Docker** is an open-source platform designed to help developers build, ship, and run applications inside lightweight, portable containers.

---

## 📦 Why Docker?

- 🚀 Faster and consistent deployments
- 📦 Package once, run anywhere
- ⚙️ Isolate applications from host environment
- 📊 Efficient resource utilization
- ☁️ Cloud-native & microservices friendly

## 📊 Docker Components

| Component       | Description                                                        |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Docker Engine** | The core service for running containers                            |
| **Docker Images** | Read-only templates used to create containers                      |
| **Docker Containers** | Lightweight, executable application packages                    |
| **Docker Hub** | Public cloud-based Docker image registry                            |
| **Docker Compose** | Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications |
| **Dockerfile** | Text file containing instructions to build a Docker image           |

---

## 🖥️ Docker Architecture

1️⃣ **Client** → 2️⃣ **Docker Daemon (Server)** → 3️⃣ **Docker Objects (Images, Containers, Volumes, Networks)**

- Docker client sends commands (via CLI)
- Docker daemon listens for requests and manages objects
- Objects include images, containers, networks, and volumes

---

## 📌 Container vs. Virtual Machine

| Container                          | Virtual Machine                     |
|:-----------------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| Shares host OS kernel              | Requires full OS for each instance  |
| Lightweight and faster to start    | Heavier, slower boot time           |
| Uses less resources                | Consumes more resources             |
| Ideal for microservices and cloud  | Good for traditional monolithic apps|

---

## 📖 Summary

Docker simplifies application delivery by **containerizing applications** and their dependencies, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
